Java Phone System
Java-Phone-System is a comprehensive Java-based phone application suite, developed as a group project for the "Software Engineering" course at Bar-Ilan University. This project simulates a full-featured phone system, complete with applications like PhoneBook, SMS, Calendar, Media, Phone Calls, Wallet, and Casino. The primary goal was to demonstrate the use of object-oriented principles, design patterns, and an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing.

The project achieved a remarkable grade of 98/100, reflecting its technical sophistication, functionality, and adherence to best practices in software engineering.
